## Scope (from the task packet)

Implement (the delta) and preserve (everything else):

- AC-001 — {{delta: behavior that changes}}
- AC-002 — {{preservation: behavior that must not change}}

Do not change: {{areas the packet rules out}}

## Behavior delta (as recorded in the sources)

Copied from the spec / change plan — not invented here. Anything not listed is preserved. No row
left undecided.

| Aspect | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| | | |

## Equivalence check for the preserved surface

The check that would *fail* if behavior outside the delta changed: differential (old path behind a
shim, diffed on the preserved surface), golden-output captured before the change, or
property-based. If the existing suite is the only check, state why it suffices for this change.

## Caller inventory

Every caller of every rewritten symbol, whole codebase, string forms included (dynamic dispatch,
registries, reflection, generated code, config). Paste the search; account for each caller.

| Caller | Updated for the new behavior / verified under the preserved one |
|---|---|
| | |

## Progress checklist

- [ ] Packet, spec, and change plan read; the delta is recorded in the sources before any code
- [ ] ACs cover the delta *and* the preserved surface
- [ ] Equivalence baseline captured before touching code; suite green
- [ ] Caller inventory complete; search output pasted
- [ ] Rewrite in batches; checks run and pasted per batch
- [ ] Delta ACs proven (flip transition pasted for new tests)
- [ ] Preserved surface proven by the equivalence check (or the sufficiency note recorded)
- [ ] Findings recorded; self-review answered

## Evidence (paste actual command output — never paraphrase)

- Check command (last lines + exit):
- Test command (last lines + exit):
- Flip transition per new delta test:
- Equivalence check output (or the recorded sufficiency justification):
- Caller search (call syntax + string form):

## Decisions

In-scope choices the requirements did not constrain. Work that grew beyond the estimate is noted
here, not reverted.

-

## Findings

"Redesign while we're here" temptations, off-delta discoveries — durable ones become native memories (see save-findings).

-

## Blocked questions

An emergent behavior change the delta does not name (halt: amend upstream or preserve), an
ambiguous AC.

-

## Next steps

-

## Self-review

Answer in writing, evidence pasted. Behavior is permitted to change here — which is exactly where
an unintended change hides.

- **Delta integrity:** does every behavior change in the diff appear in the recorded delta?
  Did anything sneak in?
- **Two surfaces:** is every delta AC proven by its check, and the preserved surface by the
  equivalence check (or recorded sufficiency note)?
- **Callers:** every caller found — string forms included — and accounted for, search pasted?
- **Scope:** nothing outside the packet's areas; off-delta discoveries recorded as findings.
- **Completeness:** nothing stubbed or half-rewritten; the next session could continue from this
  file alone.
- **Independence:** no review result issued on your own work.
